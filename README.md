# PicoMite Quick Reference
This is a small-form-factor quick reference, or cheat sheet, for [PicoMite](https://geoffg.net/picomite.html) (MMBasic) on the [PicoCalc](https://www.clockworkpi.com/picocalc) by [Clockwork Tech](https://www.clockworkpi.com/). The content in this quick reference is based on the PicoMite User Manual (v5.08.00), hosted by Clockwork Tech in their [PicoCalc repository](https://github.com/clockworkpi/PicoCalc/tree/master).
## Printing
The quick reference is intended to be printed in A5 format, but it can also be printed in A4 if you want larger text and don't mind the bigger paper size. Adjusting print settings to automatically scale the file so that it fits within the printing area is recommended. Color printing is not required.
